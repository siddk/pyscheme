eval.py

The eval() function is this really cool, but under-used function built into
the Python programming language.

Basically, eval() allows you to evaluate, or run Python code in a Python 
program. While this may seem redundant, or just unnecessary, it provides 
control flow for the majority of the interpreter. It is in the eval function 
in which most of the logic for the interpreter is done.

The eval function takes two parameters, the expression to be evaluated, as 
well as the environment in which the evaluation is done.

Here is the control flow in the eval function:
    1. First check is if the expression is a Symbol (variable) - In Python 
    this just checks if the expression is a string. The symbol is then found 
    in the environment, and returned.

    2. Second check is the constant check. If the expression is not a string, 
    or it's not a list, than it's most likely a numerical constant. Returns the constant value.

    3. Third check is for the quote special form in Scheme. The interpreter 
    supports functionality for both forms of quote, "quote" and '. Returns the
    expression as it is.

    4. Fourth check is for the "if" special form. The expression is then
    tokenized, and separated into three parts: the conditional (test), and the
    conditional statements, consequence and alternative, respectively. The
    condition is then evaluated, and the resulting term is then run through 
    the eval() function again.

    5. Fifth check is for the "set!" operator. Set! reassigns a variable or 
    field to a different value. The expression is tokenized into two parts, 
    the variable, and the expression it is being reset to. The variable is 
    then found in the respective environment, and is then reassigned.

    6. Sixth check is for the "define" special form in Scheme. Define assigns 
    a variable to a value, or a variable to an expression or function. The 
    expression is tokenized into two parts, the variable and the expression.
    This key-value pair is then inserted into the environment.

    7. Seventh check is for the "lambda" special form. Lambda creates an 
    in-line function or expression, and evaluates it. The expression is 
    tokenized into two parts, the variables and the expression. A lambda is 
    then created and returned in Python, with the variables assigned to 
    arguments in a new eval() execution.

    8. Eighth check is for the "begin" special form. The expression is 
    tokenized into whatever number of expressions, and each is then evaluated
    sequentially, by eval(). Resulting values are returned.
