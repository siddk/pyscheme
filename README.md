PyScheme
========

A Scheme Interpreter written entirely in python. Complete functionality with interactive shell. Inspired by Peter Norvig's Lispy.

This interpreter is very basic, encapsulating only basic Scheme functionality. Future iterations will include faster and more efficient code loading, as well as a focus on concurrent execution of code, a strength of Scheme.

Also supports execution of code through .scm files.
